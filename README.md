SlideDeck.js Theme
====================

This was going to be a WordPress challange sorta thing, but the time where does she go?

So now it's a full page slidedeck theme with code syntax support, a left-aligned menu and it looks pretty snazzy.

It can be seen here [here]( http://wycks.github.com/WordPress--Challenge)

The files are in the `gh-pages` branch.
