WordPress Challenge
====================

Test and improve your WordPress developer skills through a series of challenges.

The questions are [here](https://github.com/wycks/WordPress--Challenge/blob/master/questions.md) for now.

### Who is it for?  
These challenges are targeted for developers, some knowledge of CSS/HTML/PHP will be required.  
It assumes you have a test environment setup to dive right in, if you don't know how to do that, these challenges are not for you, so come back when you are ready.


### How does it work?
It will be a series of WordPress challenges organized from beginner--> intermediate--> expert.  
The questions will be very specific to show you how useful WordPress can be.  
The challenges will be step by step process found [here]( http://wycks.github.com/WordPress--Challenge)(temporary URL until it is ready)  
No answers will be supplied ( at least for now).  

### What do I need?
A default vanilla install with the twenty eleven theme.  
Download the sample data and import it into WordPress by clicking Tools -->Import -->WordPress


### ToDo
* Is the Twenty eleven theme  best for learning?  

* The actual questions will at first be in markdown, then migrated to actual sections and hosted with a javascript slider or something in HTML.  

* Actual confirmation testing, maybe write a plugin that actually tests if a challenge is complete using a combination of javascript/ajax/php and some sort of persistent way to show it?
